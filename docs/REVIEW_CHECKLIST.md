## Functional Testing Checklist

### Theme Preference
- [ ] Toggle theme from light to dark
- [ ] Verify immediate visual change
- [ ] Refresh page → theme persists
- [ ] Open in different browser → same theme
- [ ] Change theme in browser 1 → refresh browser 2 → sees change

### Pagination Settings
- [ ] Change items per page from 100 to 50
- [ ] Verify file list updates
- [ ] Refresh page → setting persists
- [ ] Open in different browser → same setting

### Active Job Tracking
- [ ] Start "Process All" batch job
- [ ] Verify progress modal appears
- [ ] Refresh page during job → warning appears
- [ ] Proceed with refresh → job resumes
- [ ] Wait for completion → warning no longer appears
- [ ] Open in different tab → sees same active job

### Error Handling
- [ ] Disconnect network → verify graceful degradation
- [ ] Invalid API response → verify error handling
- [ ] Server restart during job → job resumes
- [ ] Multiple concurrent updates → no race conditions

### Performance
- [ ] Page load time unchanged (± 50ms)
- [ ] Theme toggle is responsive
- [ ] Pagination change is responsive
- [ ] No noticeable lag in UI

## API Testing Checklist

### Preferences API

```bash
# Test 1: Get initial preferences (should have defaults)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/preferences
# Expected: {"theme": null, "perPage": 100} or similar

# Test 2: Set theme
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/preferences \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"theme": "dark"}'
# Expected: {"success": true, "message": "Preferences updated"}

# Test 3: Verify theme was saved
curl http://localhost:5000/api/preferences
# Expected: {"theme": "dark", "perPage": 100}

# Test 4: Update multiple preferences
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/preferences \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"theme": "light", "perPage": 50}'
# Expected: {"success": true}

# Test 5: Verify both updated
curl http://localhost:5000/api/preferences
# Expected: {"theme": "light", "perPage": 50}
```

### Active Job API

```bash
# Test 1: Get initial active job (should be null)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/active-job
# Expected: {"job_id": null, "job_title": null}

# Test 2: Set active job
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/active-job \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"job_id": "test-123", "job_title": "Test Job"}'
# Expected: {"success": true, "message": "Active job set"}

# Test 3: Verify active job was saved
curl http://localhost:5000/api/active-job
# Expected: {"job_id": "test-123", "job_title": "Test Job"}

# Test 4: Clear active job
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/active-job
# Expected: {"success": true, "message": "Active job cleared"}

# Test 5: Verify active job was cleared
curl http://localhost:5000/api/active-job
# Expected: {"job_id": null, "job_title": null}
```

## Database Verification

```bash
# Check database was created
ls -lh /Config/preferences.db*

# Inspect database contents
sqlite3 /Config/preferences.db "SELECT * FROM preferences;"
sqlite3 /Config/preferences.db "SELECT * FROM active_job;"

# Check database schema
sqlite3 /Config/preferences.db ".schema"
```
