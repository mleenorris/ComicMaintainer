# HTTPS Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of native HTTPS support for ComicMaintainer. The application now supports running with SSL/TLS certificates directly, without requiring a reverse proxy.

## Problem Statement

The issue requested HTTPS support for the application. While reverse proxy documentation existed, there was no native HTTPS support in the application itself.

## Solution

Implemented native HTTPS support through Gunicorn's built-in SSL/TLS capabilities, providing users with two deployment options:

1. **Direct HTTPS**: Run the application with HTTPS natively using SSL certificates
2. **Reverse Proxy HTTPS**: Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik, etc.) for HTTPS termination

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Implementation (`start.sh`)

**Location**: `/start.sh`

**Changes**:
- Added logic to detect SSL certificate environment variables
- Dynamically builds Gunicorn command with SSL options when certificates are provided
- Includes support for certificate chains via CA bundle
- Falls back to HTTP if certificates are missing or invalid
- Provides clear console output about the mode (HTTP vs HTTPS)

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Backward compatible (HTTP still works by default)
- ✅ Automatic certificate validation (checks if files exist)
- ✅ Support for certificate chains
- ✅ Clear error messages

### 2. Environment Variables

Added three new optional environment variables:

- **`SSL_CERTFILE`**: Path to SSL certificate file (e.g., `/Config/ssl/cert.crt`)
- **`SSL_KEYFILE`**: Path to SSL private key file (e.g., `/Config/ssl/cert.key`)
- **`SSL_CA_CERTS`**: Path to CA certificate bundle (optional, for certificate chains)

### 3. Certificate Generation Script

**Location**: `/generate_self_signed_cert.sh`

**Purpose**: Generate self-signed certificates for development and testing

**Features**:
- Creates 2048-bit RSA certificates
- Configurable validity period (default: 365 days)
- Configurable domain name (default: localhost)
- Includes Subject Alternative Names (SAN) for better browser compatibility
- Clear output with usage instructions and security warnings

**Usage**:
```bash
# Generate certificate in /Config/ssl directory
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/config:/Config \
  mleenorris/comicmaintainer:latest \
  /generate_self_signed_cert.sh /Config/ssl 365 localhost
```

### 4. Docker Configuration

**Dockerfile Changes**:
- Added `openssl` package for certificate generation

**docker-compose.yml Updates**:
- Added commented examples for SSL environment variables
- Included clear documentation about certificate options
- Examples for both development (self-signed) and production (trusted CA) certificates

### 5. Documentation

#### New Documents

**`docs/HTTPS_SETUP.md`**: Comprehensive guide covering:
- Direct HTTPS setup (development and production)
- Self-signed certificate generation
- Let's Encrypt integration
- Commercial certificate usage
- Port 443 configuration
- Security considerations
- Troubleshooting guide
- Comparison table (Direct HTTPS vs Reverse Proxy)

#### Updated Documents

**`README.md`**:
- Added "HTTPS Configuration" section
- Documented new environment variables
- Examples for self-signed and production certificates
- Cross-references to detailed guides

**`docs/REVERSE_PROXY.md`**:
- Added note about native HTTPS support
- Cross-reference to HTTPS Setup Guide

### 6. Tests

#### Unit Tests (`test_https_config.py`)

Tests for configuration and documentation:
- ✅ SSL configuration logic in start.sh
- ✅ Certificate generation script exists and is executable
- ✅ OpenSSL included in Dockerfile
- ✅ Docker Compose includes SSL examples
- ✅ README includes HTTPS documentation
- ✅ HTTPS Setup Guide exists and is complete
- ✅ Script syntax validation

#### Integration Tests (`test_https_integration.sh`)

End-to-end tests for HTTPS functionality:
- ✅ HTTP mode (no SSL certificates)
- ✅ HTTPS mode with certificates
- ✅ HTTPS with CA bundle
- ✅ Fallback to HTTP when certificates are missing

## Usage Examples

### Development (Self-Signed Certificate)

```bash
# Step 1: Generate certificate
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/config:/Config \
  mleenorris/comicmaintainer:latest \
  /generate_self_signed_cert.sh /Config/ssl 365 localhost

# Step 2: Run with HTTPS
docker run -d \
  -v /path/to/comics:/watched_dir \
  -v /path/to/config:/Config \
  -e WATCHED_DIR=/watched_dir \
  -e SSL_CERTFILE=/Config/ssl/selfsigned.crt \
  -e SSL_KEYFILE=/Config/ssl/selfsigned.key \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  mleenorris/comicmaintainer:latest

# Access at: https://localhost:5000
```

### Production (Let's Encrypt)

```bash
# Step 1: Obtain Let's Encrypt certificate
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com

# Step 2: Run with HTTPS
docker run -d \
  -v /path/to/comics:/watched_dir \
  -v /path/to/config:/Config \
  -v /etc/letsencrypt:/certs:ro \
  -e WATCHED_DIR=/watched_dir \
  -e SSL_CERTFILE=/certs/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem \
  -e SSL_KEYFILE=/certs/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem \
  -p 443:443 \
  -e WEB_PORT=443 \
  mleenorris/comicmaintainer:latest

# Access at: https://your-domain.com
```

## Security Considerations

### Self-Signed Certificates
⚠️ **For Development/Testing Only**
- Browsers will show security warnings
- Not suitable for production
- No protection against MITM attacks

### Production Certificates
✅ **Best Practices Implemented**:
- Gunicorn uses secure TLS defaults (TLS 1.2+)
- Certificate file validation before startup
- Read-only volume mounts for certificates (`:ro`)
- Clear separation of certificate storage
- Support for certificate chains via CA bundle

### File Permissions
Recommendations documented:
```bash
chmod 600 /path/to/certs/cert.key  # Private key
chmod 644 /path/to/certs/cert.crt  # Certificate
chown 99:100 /path/to/certs/*      # Container user
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Backward Compatible**:
- HTTP mode is the default (no breaking changes)
- HTTPS is opt-in via environment variables
- No changes required to existing deployments
- All existing tests pass without modification

## Comparison: Direct HTTPS vs Reverse Proxy

| Feature | Direct HTTPS | Reverse Proxy |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple | Moderate |
| **Best For** | Single service, development | Multiple services, production |
| **Certificate Management** | Manual | Automatic (with Let's Encrypt) |
| **Additional Features** | Basic HTTPS only | Caching, load balancing, WAF, auth |
| **Performance** | Good | Excellent (with caching) |
| **Port Flexibility** | Any port | Standard ports (80/443) |
| **Maintenance** | Manual cert renewal | Automated |

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Direct HTTPS When:
- ✅ Single service deployment
- ✅ Development or testing environment
- ✅ Simple requirements (just HTTPS)
- ✅ No need for advanced proxy features
- ✅ Learning or experimenting with HTTPS

### Use Reverse Proxy When:
- ✅ Production environment
- ✅ Multiple services to manage
- ✅ Need automatic certificate renewal
- ✅ Want caching, compression, or load balancing
- ✅ Need centralized authentication
- ✅ Require advanced security features (WAF, rate limiting)
