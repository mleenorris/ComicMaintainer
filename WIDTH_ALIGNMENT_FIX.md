# Width Alignment Fix - Header, Action Bar, and File List

## Issue
The action bar and file list elements were visually wider than the header content, creating a misalignment in the user interface.

## Root Cause
The problem was caused by **double padding** on the header container:

### Before Fix
```
.header                     → padding: 12px 20px (20px left/right)
  └─ .container            → padding: 20px (inherited from base .container)
      └─ .header-content   → Content starts at 40px from edge (20px + 20px)

Main Content:
.container                  → padding: 20px
  ├─ .actions-bar          → Content starts at 20px from edge
  └─ .file-list            → Content starts at 20px from edge
```

Result: Header content was **40px narrower** than action bar and file list.

## Solution
Added `padding: 0;` to `.header .container` to remove the inherited padding:

### After Fix
```css
.header .container {
    padding: 0;        /* ← Added this line */
    overflow: visible;
}
```

Now all elements have consistent width:
```
.header                     → padding: 12px 20px (20px left/right)
  └─ .container            → padding: 0 (override inherited padding)
      └─ .header-content   → Content starts at 20px from edge ✓

Main Content:
.container                  → padding: 20px
  ├─ .actions-bar          → Content starts at 20px from edge ✓
  └─ .file-list            → Content starts at 20px from edge ✓
```

## Files Changed
- `templates/index.html` - Line 97: Added `padding: 0;` to `.header .container`

## Testing
- ✅ Desktop viewport (>1024px): All elements align perfectly
- ✅ Tablet viewport (769px-1024px): Inherits desktop fix, works correctly
- ✅ Mobile viewport (<768px): Already had correct `padding: 0` setting
- ✅ Empty state message: Properly contained within file list

## Visual Proof

## Impact
- **Minimal change**: Single line of CSS added
- **No breaking changes**: Mobile layout already had this setting
- **Consistent design**: All major UI elements now have matching width
- **Improved UX**: Better visual hierarchy and cleaner interface
