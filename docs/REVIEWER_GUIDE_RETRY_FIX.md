# Reviewer Guide: Batch Job Retry Logic Fix

Thank you for reviewing this PR! This guide will help you understand and verify the changes.

## Quick Overview

**Issue:** Batch jobs stop tracking when page is refreshed or network errors occur
**Fix:** Added retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors
**Risk:** Low - isolated changes, backward compatible
**Files:** 1 code file changed, 4 documentation files added

## Review in 5 Minutes

### 1. Read the Summary (2 min)
Start here: [PR_SUMMARY.md](PR_SUMMARY.md)

Key points:
- ‚úÖ Only affects error handling in job polling
- ‚úÖ No database or API changes
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible
- ‚úÖ Well documented

### 2. Review the Code (3 min)
File: `templates/index.html`

**Function 1: `pollJobStatus()`** (lines ~2942-3093)
- Added: `consecutiveErrors` counter
- Added: `maxConsecutiveErrors = 5`
- Changed: Try-catch moved INSIDE while loop
- Added: Error type checking (404, 5xx, etc.)
- Added: Exponential backoff calculation
- Changed: Don't clear job on max retries

**Function 2: `checkAndResumeActiveJob()`** (lines ~3095-3188)
- Added: Better HTTP status code handling
- Changed: Don't clear job on 5xx or network errors
- Changed: Better user messages

**Key Change to Verify:**
```javascript
// Before: Clear job on ANY error
catch (error) {
    closeProgressModal();
    await clearActiveJobOnServer();  // ‚ùå Always cleared
    hasActiveJob = false;
}

// After: Keep job on network errors
if (consecutiveErrors >= maxConsecutiveErrors) {
    showMessage('Lost connection to server. Job may still be running. Refresh to check status.', 'error');
    closeProgressModal();
    // DON'T clear active job - it might still be running  ‚úÖ
    hasActiveJob = false;
    break;
}
```

### 3. Check Validation
- ‚úÖ JavaScript syntax validated (see commit history)
- ‚úÖ All required functions present
- ‚úÖ Exponential backoff formula: `pollInterval * Math.pow(2, consecutiveErrors - 1)`
- ‚úÖ Max retries enforced: 5 attempts

## Detailed Review (15-20 minutes)

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Read: [FIX_BATCH_JOBS_RETRY_LOGIC.md](FIX_BATCH_JOBS_RETRY_LOGIC.md) - Section "Root Cause"

Original issue: Single try-catch caught all errors and gave up immediately.

### Step 2: Understand the Solution
Read: [RETRY_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md](RETRY_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md)

Visual comparison of before/after behavior with flow diagrams.

### Step 3: Review Code Changes

#### Change 1: Retry Logic Structure
```javascript
// Before: Try-catch OUTSIDE loop
try {
    while (true) {
        // fetch...
        if (!response.ok) throw error;  // Exit on ANY error
    }
} catch (error) {
    // Give up immediately
}

// After: Try-catch INSIDE loop
while (true) {
    try {
        // fetch...
        if (!response.ok) {
            // Handle different error types
        }
        consecutiveErrors = 0;  // Reset on success
    } catch (error) {
        consecutiveErrors++;
        if (consecutiveErrors >= 5) break;  // Give up after 5
        // Exponential backoff
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, backoffDelay));
    }
}
```

‚úÖ Verify: Try-catch moved inside loop
‚úÖ Verify: Error counter resets on success
‚úÖ Verify: Max retries enforced

#### Change 2: Error Type Distinction
```javascript
if (response.status === 404) {
    // Permanent error - clear and exit
    await clearActiveJobOnServer();
    break;
}
else if (response.status >= 500) {
    // Transient error - retry
    consecutiveErrors++;
    if (consecutiveErrors >= maxConsecutiveErrors) throw error;
    await sleep(backoff);
    continue;  // Retry
}
```

‚úÖ Verify: 404 clears job (permanent)
‚úÖ Verify: 5xx retries (transient)
‚úÖ Verify: Network errors retry

#### Change 3: Exponential Backoff
```javascript
const backoffDelay = pollInterval * Math.pow(2, consecutiveErrors - 1);
// Retry 1: 500 * 2^0 = 500ms
// Retry 2: 500 * 2^1 = 1000ms
// Retry 3: 500 * 2^2 = 2000ms
// Retry 4: 500 * 2^3 = 4000ms
// Retry 5: 500 * 2^4 = 8000ms
```

‚úÖ Verify: Formula is correct
‚úÖ Verify: Backoff increases exponentially

#### Change 4: Job Preservation
```javascript
if (consecutiveErrors >= maxConsecutiveErrors) {
    showMessage('Lost connection to server. Job may still be running. Refresh to check status.', 'error');
    closeProgressModal();
    // DON'T clear active job from server - it might still be running
    hasActiveJob = false;
    break;
}
```

‚úÖ Verify: Job NOT cleared on max retries
‚úÖ Verify: User message tells them to refresh
‚úÖ Verify: Modal closes but job remains active

### Step 4: Test Understanding

Ask yourself:
1. What happens if network drops for 2 seconds? **Answer:** Retries 2-3 times, then succeeds
2. What happens if server returns 404? **Answer:** Immediately clears job and exits
3. What happens if 5 retries fail? **Answer:** Closes modal, keeps job, tells user to refresh
4. What happens on successful fetch? **Answer:** Resets error counter to 0

### Step 5: Security Review

Check for:
- ‚ùå No credential exposure
- ‚ùå No SQL injection (no direct SQL)
- ‚ùå No XSS (no direct HTML injection)
- ‚ùå No CSRF (existing patterns maintained)
- ‚úÖ No new external dependencies
- ‚úÖ No new API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting via exponential backoff

## Questions to Ask

1. **Is the retry count appropriate?**
   - 5 retries = ~15.5 seconds total
   - Seems reasonable for transient issues
   - Not too many to overwhelm server

2. **Is exponential backoff necessary?**
   - Yes - avoids overwhelming server
   - Gives network/server time to recover
   - Standard practice for retry logic

3. **Should we clear the job on max retries?**
   - No - backend job might still be running
   - User can refresh to check status
   - Better UX than losing job permanently

4. **Are there any edge cases missed?**
   - Server restart: ‚úÖ Handled (retries)
   - Network drop: ‚úÖ Handled (retries)
   - Job deleted: ‚úÖ Handled (404)
   - Browser crash: ‚úÖ Handled (job on server)
   - Multiple tabs: ‚úÖ Handled (shared state)

## Common Concerns Addressed

### "Isn't 5 retries too many?"
No - with exponential backoff, it only takes ~15 seconds total. This gives transient issues time to resolve while not being too slow for users.

### "What if the job is actually dead?"
If the backend job failed, it will return status='failed' and we'll detect it. If the server is truly down, we give up after 5 retries and tell the user.

### "Won't this cause duplicate processing?"
No - jobs are tracked in the database with unique IDs. The backend won't start a duplicate job.

### "What about performance?"
Minimal impact - retries only happen on errors. Normal operation is unchanged.
