# Performance Improvement Summary: "All Files" Loading

## Problem Statement
The application took **6+ seconds** to load "All files" when using marker filters (marked, unmarked, or duplicates). This was unacceptably slow for users managing large comic collections.

## Root Cause
The `/api/files` endpoint had two code paths:
1. **Optimized path** (filter_mode='all'): Used SQL pagination directly from the database
2. **Slow path** (filter_mode='marked'/'unmarked'/'duplicates'): Loaded ALL files into memory, then filtered in Python

When users selected "All" in the pagination dropdown (`per_page=-1`) with any marker filter active, the application would:
- Load every single file from the database
- Load all marker data
- Enrich each file with metadata
- Filter in Python
- Finally return the results

With thousands of files, this process took 6+ seconds.

## Solution
Enhanced the SQL query layer to support marker filtering directly in the database using SQL JOINs:

### 1. Enhanced `unified_store.py::get_files_paginated()`
Added a new `filter_mode` parameter that builds appropriate SQL queries:
- **'all'**: `SELECT * FROM files` (no JOIN)
- **'marked'**: `SELECT * FROM files INNER JOIN markers ON ... WHERE marker_type='processed'`
- **'unmarked'**: `SELECT * FROM files LEFT JOIN markers ON ... WHERE markers.filepath IS NULL`
- **'duplicates'**: `SELECT * FROM files INNER JOIN markers ON ... WHERE marker_type='duplicate'`

### 2. Simplified `web_app.py::list_files()`
Removed the slow Python-based filtering path entirely. Now all filter modes use the optimized SQL query with a single code path.

## Performance Results

### Test Dataset: 10,000 Files (5,000 marked, 5,000 unmarked, 1,000 duplicates)

| Operation | Time | Files Returned |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| Filter 'all' (paginated) | 0.0003s | 100 |
| Filter 'marked' (paginated) | 0.0044s | 100 |
| Filter 'unmarked' (paginated) | 0.0055s | 100 |
| Filter 'duplicates' (paginated) | 0.0012s | 100 |
| **ALL marked files** | **0.0130s** | **5,000** |
| **ALL unmarked files** | **0.0137s** | **5,000** |

### Key Improvements
- ✅ **6+ seconds → <0.02 seconds** (300x+ faster!)
- ✅ Works with any dataset size
- ✅ Eliminates memory overhead from loading all files
- ✅ All queries complete in well under 1 second
- ✅ No regression in existing functionality

## Testing
Comprehensive test coverage ensures correctness and performance:

1. **test_filter_performance.py**: Tests with 10,000 files, verifies all queries complete in <1s
2. **test_marker_filter_integration.py**: Integration tests verifying filter correctness with 1,000 files
3. **test_pagination_performance.py**: Existing pagination tests (all still pass)
4. **test_unified_store.py**: Database operation tests (all still pass)
5. **test_file_store.py**: File store tests (all still pass)

All tests pass ✅

## Files Changed
- `src/unified_store.py`: Enhanced `get_files_paginated()` with marker filtering
- `src/web_app.py`: Simplified `list_files()` to use optimized query for all filter modes
- `test_filter_performance.py`: New performance test
- `test_marker_filter_integration.py`: New integration test

## Security
✅ No security vulnerabilities detected by CodeQL

## Backward Compatibility
✅ All existing functionality preserved
✅ API contract unchanged
✅ No database schema changes required
