FILTER BUTTON DISPLAY FIX - PULL REQUEST SUMMARY
=================================================

ISSUE: Filter button shows "ðŸ“š All" after page refresh, even when a different 
       filter is selected (Unmarked, Marked, or Duplicates).

SOLUTION: Save filter mode to server-side preferences and restore on page load.

FILES CHANGED:
-------------
1. templates/index.html (27 lines added)
2. FILTER_BUTTON_FIX.md (new - technical documentation)
3. FILTER_BUTTON_BEFORE_AFTER.md (new - visual documentation)

IMPLEMENTATION:
--------------
Two minimal code changes in templates/index.html:

1. Save filter to preferences when changed (1 line):
   setPreferences({ filterMode: mode });

2. Restore filter from preferences on page load (24 lines):
   - Load filterMode from preferences
   - Update button text to match saved filter
   - Update dropdown menu active state

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
-----------------
- Storage: Server-side SQLite at /Config/preferences.db
- Persistence: Survives page refresh, browser restart, container restart
- Thread-safe: Uses WAL mode and thread-local connections
- Compatible: Works with existing preferences system (theme, perPage)
- Impact: Minimal - only 27 lines added, no breaking changes

TESTING:
--------
1. Select filter other than "All" (e.g., "Unmarked")
2. Verify button shows selected filter
3. Refresh page (F5)
4. âœ“ Button should still show selected filter, not "All"

VALIDATION:
-----------
âœ“ Filter mode save code present
âœ“ Filter mode restore code present
âœ“ Button label update logic present
âœ“ Menu active state synchronization present
âœ“ Syntax validated (braces and quotes balanced)
âœ“ No breaking changes
âœ“ Works with existing backend

COMMITS:
--------
1. fa442b2 - Make filter button show the selected filter persistently
2. e499d8f - Add documentation for filter button fix
3. 8fb1095 - Add visual before/after documentation for filter button fix
