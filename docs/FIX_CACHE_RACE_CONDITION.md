# Fix: Cache Race Condition Causing Empty File Lists

## Issue Description

After a synchronous cache build, no files were shown in the web interface. The logs showed:
```
[WEBPAGE] WARNING Cache still empty after waiting, returning empty list
[WEBPAGE] INFO Async cache rebuild in progress, but no stale cache available
[WEBPAGE] INFO No stale cache available, building synchronously for first request
[WEBPAGE] INFO Waiting briefly for async cache rebuild to complete
[WEBPAGE] WARNING Cache still empty after waiting, returning empty list
[WEBPAGE] INFO Async cache rebuild: Complete (10494 files)
```

## Root Cause

A race condition occurred when multiple requests arrived during initial startup:

1. **First request** triggers an async cache rebuild (takes ~3-5 seconds for large libraries)
2. **Second request** arrives while async rebuild is in progress
3. Second request sees `rebuild_in_progress = True` but no stale cache
4. Second request falls through to synchronous build path
5. Synchronous build tries to acquire lock but fails (async thread has it)
6. **Bug**: Second request waits only 0.5 seconds then returns empty list
7. Later, async rebuild completes successfully but earlier requests already returned empty

## The Fix

Modified `get_enriched_file_list()` in `web_app.py` to properly wait for async rebuild:

**Before:**
```python
if lock_fd is None:
    logging.info("Waiting briefly for async cache rebuild to complete")
    time.sleep(0.5)
    with enriched_file_cache_lock:
        if enriched_file_cache['files'] is not None:
            return enriched_file_cache['files']
    # Still no cache, return empty list
    logging.warning("Cache still empty after waiting, returning empty list")
    return []
```

**After:**
```python
if lock_fd is None:
    # Another worker is building, wait for async rebuild to complete
    # Poll the cache every 0.5 seconds for up to 10 seconds
    logging.info("Waiting for async cache rebuild to complete")
    max_wait_time = 10  # seconds
    poll_interval = 0.5  # seconds
    wait_start = time.time()
    
    while time.time() - wait_start < max_wait_time:
        time.sleep(poll_interval)
        with enriched_file_cache_lock:
            if enriched_file_cache['files'] is not None:
                logging.info(f"Async cache rebuild completed after {time.time() - wait_start:.1f}s")
                return enriched_file_cache['files']
    
    # Still no cache after max wait time, return empty list
    logging.warning(f"Cache still empty after waiting {max_wait_time}s, returning empty list")
    return []
```

## Key Changes

1. **Increased wait time**: From 0.5s to up to 10s
2. **Active polling**: Check cache every 0.5s instead of single check
3. **Better logging**: Report actual wait time when cache becomes available
4. **Graceful degradation**: Still returns empty list if cache takes >10s (shouldn't happen)

## Benefits

✅ Fixes "empty file list" issue on startup
✅ Handles concurrent requests properly
✅ Works with Gunicorn multi-worker setups
✅ Minimal code change (surgical fix)
✅ No performance impact (only affects initial requests)

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Worker, Cold Start
- Request 1: Triggers async rebuild, waits and returns populated cache
- ✅ No empty lists returned

### Scenario 2: Multiple Workers, Cold Start
- Request 1 (Worker A): Starts async rebuild
- Request 2 (Worker B): Polls cache, returns when Worker A completes
- ✅ No empty lists returned

### Scenario 3: Subsequent Requests
- Cache already populated
- Returns immediately (no waiting)
- ✅ No performance impact

## Log Output After Fix

Expected logs on startup:
```
[WEBPAGE] INFO Triggering async cache rebuild
[WEBPAGE] INFO No stale cache available, building synchronously for first request
[WEBPAGE] INFO Waiting for async cache rebuild to complete
[WEBPAGE] INFO Async cache rebuild: Complete (10494 files)
[WEBPAGE] INFO Async cache rebuild completed after 3.2s
```

No more "Cache still empty after waiting, returning empty list" warnings.
