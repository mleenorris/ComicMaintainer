# Implementation Summary: Test Branch Docker Build

## Overview

This PR successfully implements the requirement to create a test branch from the end of PR #338 and configure Docker builds to tag it as "test".

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Docker Build Workflow Configuration

**File**: `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`

**Changes**:
- Added `test` branch to the push trigger branches (line 5)
- Added conditional logic to tag Docker images from the test branch as `iceburn1/comictagger-watcher:test` (lines 38-40)

**Impact**:
- When commits are pushed to the `test` branch, the Docker workflow will automatically build and push an image tagged as `test`
- This allows users to pull and test the image using: `docker pull iceburn1/comictagger-watcher:test`

### 2. Branch Creation Script

**File**: `create-test-branch.sh`

**Features**:
- Creates the test branch from commit `57821b3fb90a52afb44652c4ca62b0b39f89fe07` (end of PR #338)
- Includes comprehensive error handling:
  - Checks if the target commit exists
  - Handles existing branch conflicts with user prompts
  - Validates git operations with proper error messages
- Follows bash best practices with `set -e` for fail-fast behavior

**Usage**:
```bash
chmod +x create-test-branch.sh
./create-test-branch.sh
```

### 3. Documentation

**File**: `TEST_BRANCH_SETUP.md`

**Content**:
- Complete explanation of the test branch setup
- Branch creation instructions (both automated and manual)
- Docker tag mapping table for all branches
- Usage examples for pulling and using the test Docker image
- Details about what features are included in the test branch

## Test Branch Details

- **Branch Name**: `test`
- **Based On**: Commit `57821b3fb90a52afb44652c4ca62b0b39f89fe07`
- **Source**: End of PR #338 (Implement automatic version bumping on merge to master)
- **Docker Tag**: `iceburn1/comictagger-watcher:test`

## Docker Tag Strategy

| Branch | Docker Tag(s) | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| master | `latest`, `<version>` | Production releases with version pinning |
| stable | `stable` | Stable production branch |
| test   | `test` | Testing branch from PR #338 |

## What's Included in the Test Branch

The test branch includes all changes up to and including PR #338:
- ✅ Automatic version bumping workflow
- ✅ Enhanced Docker image tagging with version numbers
- ✅ Version test suite
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for automated versioning

## Next Steps

To activate the test branch and Docker builds:

1. **Create the test branch**:
   ```bash
   ./create-test-branch.sh
   ```
   Or manually with proper permissions:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test 57821b3fb90a52afb44652c4ca62b0b39f89fe07
   git push -u origin test
   ```

2. **Verify the workflow**: Once pushed, check GitHub Actions to ensure the Docker build workflow runs successfully

3. **Pull the test image**:
   ```bash
   docker pull iceburn1/comictagger-watcher:test
   ```

## Validation

- ✅ YAML syntax validated successfully
- ✅ Bash script syntax validated successfully
- ✅ Code review completed with all feedback addressed
- ✅ Security scan completed (CodeQL) - no issues found
- ✅ Error handling added to branch creation script
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation provided

## Notes

- The actual creation and pushing of the test branch requires repository write permissions
- The provided script handles error cases gracefully
- Once the test branch is created, Docker builds will trigger automatically on push
