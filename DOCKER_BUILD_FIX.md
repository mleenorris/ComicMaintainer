# Docker Build Failure Fix

## Problem

The Docker build workflows were failing with intermittent 503 errors from Docker Hub:

```
ERROR: Error response from daemon: Head "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/moby/buildkit/manifests/buildx-stable-1": 
received unexpected HTTP status: 503 Service Unavailable
```

This error occurs when Docker Hub's authentication or registry services are temporarily unavailable, which can happen during:
- High load periods
- Maintenance windows
- Network issues
- Rate limiting

## Root Cause

The original GitHub Actions workflows did not have any retry logic. When Docker Hub returned a 503 error during the build process, the entire workflow would fail immediately, even though the issue was transient and would likely succeed on a retry.

## Solution

Added automatic retry logic to both GitHub Actions workflows to handle transient failures:

### Changes to `docker-publish.yml`

1. **Enhanced Buildx Setup**: Updated `docker/setup-buildx-action` with explicit driver options:
   - Uses the latest buildkit image
   - Configures host networking for better reliability

2. **3-Attempt Retry Logic**: 
   - First attempt: Standard build and push
   - Second attempt: Automatic retry if first fails
   - Third attempt: Final retry if second fails
   - Explicit failure only after all 3 attempts fail

3. **Additional Improvements**:
   - Added `provenance: false` to simplify builds and reduce potential failure points
   - Each retry attempt uses the same cache to speed up rebuilds
   - Clear status checks with descriptive error messages

### Changes to `security-scan.yml`

Applied the same retry logic to the Docker image build step used for security scanning:
- Same 3-attempt retry pattern
- Same buildx configuration improvements
- Ensures security scans can complete even with intermittent Docker Hub issues

## Benefits

✅ **Improved Reliability**: Workflows now handle transient Docker Hub failures automatically  
✅ **No Manual Intervention**: Retries happen automatically without requiring manual workflow re-runs  
✅ **Faster Recovery**: Uses cached layers on retry attempts for faster rebuilds  
✅ **Clear Failure Messages**: Only fails after all attempts exhausted, with clear error messages  
✅ **Maintains Functionality**: All existing features (caching, pushing, tagging) preserved  

## Testing

The changes have been validated:
- ✅ YAML syntax validated for both workflow files
- ✅ Workflow structure verified
- ✅ Retry logic confirmed with conditional steps
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Impact

These changes will significantly reduce CI/CD failures due to transient Docker Hub issues. According to Docker Hub status reports, most 503 errors resolve within seconds to minutes, making a 3-attempt retry strategy highly effective.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for consideration:
- Add exponential backoff between retries (e.g., wait 30s, then 60s)
- Implement health checks before attempting builds
- Add monitoring/alerting for retry patterns
- Consider using GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) as a fallback or alternative
