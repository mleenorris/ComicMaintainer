# Creating the dotnet Branch

## Objective
Create a new branch called `dotnet` based on the `master` branch.

## Status
âœ… The `dotnet` branch has been created locally from `master` (commit 25dce09 - v1.0.42)

## Manual Step Required
Due to GitHub authentication limitations in the automated environment, the `dotnet` branch needs to be pushed to the remote repository manually.

### Command to Push the Branch
```bash
git push -u origin dotnet:dotnet
```

Or, you can create the branch directly on GitHub:
1. Go to https://github.com/mleenorris/ComicMaintainer
2. Click on the branch dropdown
3. Type "dotnet" and select "Create branch: dotnet from 'master'"

## Verification
Once pushed, verify the branch exists:
```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin dotnet
```

The branch should point to commit: `25dce09cba07e8a1270ef52d38f29e5b582b696b`
