# Reverse Proxy Security Fix - "Connection Not Secure" Issue

## Problem Statement
Chrome showed "Connection Not Secure" warning when accessing ComicMaintainer through a reverse proxy with HTTPS configured. This prevented proper PWA (Progressive Web App) functionality and caused user confusion.

## Root Cause Analysis

When using a reverse proxy with HTTPS:
1. The reverse proxy terminates SSL/TLS and forwards requests to the backend over HTTP
2. The backend application needs to be aware that the original request was over HTTPS
3. Browsers require specific security headers (HSTS, CSP) to treat the connection as fully secure
4. Without these headers, Chrome shows "Not Secure" warnings even when accessed via HTTPS

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Automatic HTTPS Detection
The application now detects when it's behind an HTTPS reverse proxy by checking:
- `X-Forwarded-Proto` header value
- `request.scheme` value

### 2. Security Headers
When HTTPS is detected, the application automatically adds:

#### HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```
- Tells browsers to **always** use HTTPS for this domain
- `max-age=31536000` = 1 year
- `includeSubDomains` ensures all subdomains are also protected
- Prevents downgrade attacks and accidental HTTP access

#### CSP (Content Security Policy)
```http
Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests
```
- Tells browsers to automatically upgrade HTTP requests to HTTPS
- Prevents mixed content warnings
- Ensures all resources (images, scripts, etc.) are loaded over HTTPS

### 3. Implementation Details

**Location**: `src/web_app.py` in the `add_performance_headers` function

```python
@app.after_request
def add_performance_headers(response):
    """Add performance-related headers to responses"""
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Add security headers when behind HTTPS proxy
    # Check if request came through HTTPS (via X-Forwarded-Proto header)
    if request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Proto') == 'https' or request.scheme == 'https':
        # HSTS: Tell browsers to always use HTTPS for this domain
        # max-age=31536000 = 1 year
        response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
        
        # Upgrade insecure requests: Tell browser to upgrade HTTP requests to HTTPS
        response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "upgrade-insecure-requests"
    
    return response
```

### Test Results
```
Security Headers Test:
  ✓ HTTP request: No HSTS header (correct behavior)
  ✓ HTTPS request: HSTS header present with correct values
  ✓ HTTPS request: CSP header present with upgrade-insecure-requests
  ✓ HSTS max-age: 31536000 (1 year)
  ✓ HSTS includeSubDomains: present

Reverse Proxy Test:
  ✓ ProxyFix import successful
  ✓ web_app.py syntax valid
  ✓ ProxyFix middleware configured
  ✓ Gunicorn forwarded-allow-ips configured
  ✓ Security headers configured
  ✓ Documentation includes troubleshooting

All tests passed: 6/6 test suites
```

## Security Analysis

### Security Improvements
1. **HSTS**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring HTTPS-only
2. **CSP upgrade-insecure-requests**: Prevents mixed content vulnerabilities
3. **No new vulnerabilities**: Bandit scan confirms no security regressions
4. **Industry standard**: Follows OWASP recommendations

### Security Headers Analysis
- **HSTS max-age**: 1 year is the recommended minimum for HSTS preloading
- **includeSubDomains**: Protects all subdomains from downgrade attacks
- **CSP upgrade-insecure-requests**: Recommended by W3C for HTTPS migrations
