## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker (for container testing)
- Git

### Install Development Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Create Test Environment

```bash
# Create /Config directory for tests
sudo mkdir -p /Config
sudo chmod 777 /Config
```

### Run the Application Locally

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export WATCHED_DIR=/path/to/test/comics
export WEB_PORT=5000

# Start the web application
python src/web_app.py
```

## Making Changes

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add health check endpoint for container orchestration

- Added /health and /api/health endpoints
- Returns status of watched directory, database, and watcher
- Returns 200 OK for healthy, 503 for unhealthy
```

## Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
pytest -v
```

### Run Specific Test File

```bash
pytest test_file_store.py -v
```

### Run Tests with Coverage

```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Add New Tests

When adding new features:
1. Create or update test files in the project root
2. Follow existing test patterns
3. Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
4. Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

## Code Quality

### Run Linters

```bash
# Pylint
pylint src/*.py

# Flake8
flake8 src/
```

### Security Scanning

```bash
# Bandit - Python security scanner
bandit -r src/ -c .bandit

# pip-audit - Check dependencies for vulnerabilities
pip-audit -r requirements.txt
```

### Pre-commit Checks

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] Security scans pass
- [ ] Code is properly formatted
- [ ] Documentation is updated

## Submitting Changes
