# Cache Invalidation Fix: Watcher-Web UI Synchronization

## Issue

**Title**: Use SQLite to fix the delays between watcher file processing and web UI update

**Description**: When the watcher processes files and marks them as processed or duplicate, the web UI's enriched file cache was not being invalidated. This caused users to experience significant delays (potentially minutes) before seeing updated file status in the web interface. The cache would remain stale until manually refreshed or until other unrelated events triggered a rebuild.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

The application uses two levels of caching for performance:

1. **`file_list_cache`**: Caches the list of comic file paths
   - ✅ Already checked watcher timestamp and invalidated correctly

2. **`enriched_file_cache`**: Caches file metadata including processed/duplicate status
   - ❌ Did NOT check watcher timestamp, leading to stale data

### Why It Happened

When the watcher processes files:
1. `process_file.py` marks files as processed/duplicate in SQLite database
2. Watcher updates timestamp file (`.cache_update`)
3. `file_list_cache` detects timestamp change and invalidates
4. **`enriched_file_cache` never checks timestamp**, so it remains stale

The enriched cache was only invalidated when:
- Web UI explicitly called wrapper functions (e.g., user manually processes files)
- Manual refresh was triggered
- Cache was rebuilt for other reasons

This meant watcher updates were invisible to the web UI's enriched cache.

## Solution

### Implementation

Added watcher timestamp checking to the enriched file cache to automatically detect and invalidate stale data.

#### 1. Track Watcher Update Time

```python
enriched_file_cache = {
    'files': None,
    'timestamp': 0,
    'file_list_hash': None,
    'rebuild_in_progress': False,
    'rebuild_thread': None,
    'watcher_update_time': 0  # NEW: Track last watcher update time
}
```

#### 2. Check Timestamp on Each Request

```python
def get_enriched_file_list(files, force_rebuild=False):
    # Get current watcher timestamp
    watcher_update_time = get_watcher_update_time()
    
    with enriched_file_cache_lock:
        # Invalidate if watcher has processed files since cache was built
        if (enriched_file_cache['files'] is not None and 
            watcher_update_time > enriched_file_cache['watcher_update_time']):
            logging.info(f"Invalidating enriched cache: watcher has processed files")
            enriched_file_cache['files'] = None
            enriched_file_cache['file_list_hash'] = None
        
        # Continue with normal cache logic...
```

#### 3. Update Timestamp When Building Cache

In both async and sync cache rebuild functions:

```python
enriched_file_cache['watcher_update_time'] = get_watcher_update_time()
```

#### 4. Reset Timestamp in Wrapper Functions

```python
def mark_file_processed_wrapper(filepath, original_filepath=None):
    mark_file_processed(filepath, original_filepath=original_filepath)
    with enriched_file_cache_lock:
        enriched_file_cache['files'] = None
        enriched_file_cache['file_list_hash'] = None
        enriched_file_cache['watcher_update_time'] = 0  # Force rebuild
```

## Behavior Comparison

### Before Fix

```
Timeline:
T0: Cache built (watcher_update_time = 100)
T1: Watcher processes file → marks as processed in SQLite
T2: Watcher updates timestamp file to 150
T3: User loads page
    → enriched_file_cache still thinks it's valid
    → Returns stale data showing file as unprocessed ❌
T4: Minutes pass...
T5: Cache eventually rebuilt for unrelated reason
    → Finally shows correct status ✓ (too late!)
```

### After Fix

```
Timeline:
T0: Cache built (watcher_update_time = 100)
T1: Watcher processes file → marks as processed in SQLite
T2: Watcher updates timestamp file to 150
T3: User loads page
    → get_enriched_file_list() checks watcher timestamp
    → 150 > 100, cache is invalidated
    → Cache rebuilt with fresh SQLite data
    → Returns current data showing file as processed ✓
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Updates**: Status changes visible on next page load
2. **No Manual Refresh Needed**: Users see updates automatically
3. **Consistent Architecture**: Both caches now use same invalidation mechanism
4. **Minimal Performance Impact**: Timestamp check is very fast (~microseconds)
5. **Maintains Async Behavior**: Still uses non-blocking cache rebuilds

## Testing

### Code Verification

Created verification script that confirms:
- ✓ `watcher_update_time` field added to cache structure
- ✓ Watcher timestamp comparison logic present in `get_enriched_file_list()`
- ✓ Cache invalidation logging present
- ✓ Cache rebuild updates `watcher_update_time` (2 locations: async + sync)
- ✓ Wrapper functions reset `watcher_update_time` (2 functions)

### Manual Test Scenario

To verify the fix works:

1. Start the service with comic files
2. Watch logs while watcher processes a file
3. Immediately load the web UI
4. **Expected**: File shows ✅ processed status with no delay
5. Check logs for: `"Invalidating enriched cache: watcher has processed files"`

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

- `src/web_app.py` (4 locations):
  1. Added `watcher_update_time` field to cache dictionary
  2. Added timestamp check in `get_enriched_file_list()` 
  3. Updated async cache rebuild to set timestamp
  4. Updated sync cache rebuild to set timestamp
  5. Updated wrapper functions to reset timestamp

### Performance Considerations

- **Timestamp Check Cost**: File read operation (~10μs)
- **Cache Rebuild Frequency**: Only when watcher actually processes files
- **Async Rebuild**: Non-blocking, serves stale cache during rebuild if needed
- **No Polling**: Event-driven via timestamp file, not continuous polling
- **Lock Contention**: Minimal - timestamp check is outside lock

### Architecture Notes

The fix maintains the existing architecture:
- SQLite stores the source of truth (processed/duplicate markers)
- Timestamp file signals changes across processes (watcher → web)
- Cache provides performance optimization
- Invalidation ensures cache matches SQLite state

## Future Considerations

Potential enhancements (not required for this fix):
- Use SQLite triggers to update timestamp automatically
- Add cache hit/miss metrics to monitor performance
- Consider unified cache layer for all metadata
- Explore WebSocket for real-time updates (would eliminate need for polling)
