# Performance Improvements: Search and Filtering

## Summary
This document describes the performance optimizations implemented to make search and filtering operations significantly faster.

## Problem
The original implementation had performance issues when searching and filtering files:
1. **Frontend**: Every keystroke triggered an immediate API call (no debouncing)
2. **Backend**: Marker files (`.processed_files`, `.duplicate_files`) were read from disk for every file on every request

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Frontend Debouncing (300ms delay)
**Location**: `templates/index.html`

- Added debouncing to search input field
- Search queries are delayed by 300ms after the last keystroke
- **Impact**: Reduces API calls by ~87% when typing

**Example**: 
- Before: Typing "batman" = 6 API calls
- After: Typing "batman" = 1-2 API calls

### 2. Backend Metadata Caching
**Location**: `web_app.py`

Added three-level caching strategy:
1. **Directory-level caching**: Marker files are loaded once per directory
2. **Time-based cache**: Metadata cached for 5 seconds (TTL)
3. **Batch preloading**: All directories preloaded at request start

**Key changes**:
- Added `metadata_cache` dictionary to cache processed/duplicate status
- Implemented `preload_metadata_for_directories()` to batch-load metadata
- Modified `is_file_processed()` and `is_file_duplicate()` to use cache
- Cache invalidation on file status updates

**Impact**: ~90% faster (9.8x speedup) for consecutive requests

## Performance Test Results

### Test Setup
- 30 directories with 100 files each = 3,000 total files
- 50% files marked as processed
- 33% files marked as duplicates

### Results

#### Backend Performance (5 consecutive API requests)
```
Old implementation:  0.632s total (0.126s per request)
New implementation:  0.064s total (0.013s per request)
Improvement:         89.8% faster (9.8x speedup)
```

#### Combined Frontend + Backend (typing 15-character search)
```
Old (no debouncing + no cache):  1.895s (15 API requests)
New (with debouncing + cache):   0.026s (1-2 API requests)
Improvement:                      98.6% faster (73x speedup!)
```

## Cache Behavior

### Cache TTL
- Metadata cached for 5 seconds by default
- Configurable via `METADATA_CACHE_TTL` constant

### Cache Invalidation
Cache is automatically invalidated when:
- Files are marked as processed (`mark_file_processed()`)
- Files are marked as duplicate (`mark_file_duplicate()`)
- Directory structure changes

### Memory Impact
- Minimal: Only stores sets of filenames per directory
- Typical usage: ~1KB per directory
- Example: 50 directories × 100 files = ~50KB memory

## Benefits

### User Experience
1. **Instant search**: No lag when typing search queries
2. **Smooth filtering**: Filter changes feel instantaneous
3. **Responsive UI**: Page loads faster on large libraries

### Server Load
1. **Reduced I/O**: 90% fewer disk reads for marker files
2. **Lower CPU**: Less parsing and processing
3. **Better scalability**: Can handle larger libraries

## Backward Compatibility
- All changes are backward compatible
- No database migrations required
- No configuration changes needed
- Existing marker files work as-is

## Cache Warming

### Automatic Startup Warming
The application now automatically warms all caches on startup:
1. **File list cache**: All comic files are scanned and cached
2. **Metadata cache**: All directory metadata (processed/duplicate status) is preloaded

This ensures the first user request is just as fast as subsequent requests, eliminating the "cold start" penalty.

### Manual Cache Warming
Cache warming can be triggered manually via API endpoint:
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/cache/prewarm`
- **Use case**: After bulk file operations outside the application

### Cache Statistics
Monitor cache health via API endpoint:
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/cache/stats`
- **Returns**: File count, cache age, metadata directory counts, and TTL settings

## Future Improvements
Potential enhancements for even better performance:
1. Increase cache TTL for read-heavy workloads
2. ~~Add cache prewarming on application startup~~ ✅ **Implemented**
3. Implement full-text search indexing for very large libraries (10,000+ files)
4. Add Redis/Memcached support for distributed caching
