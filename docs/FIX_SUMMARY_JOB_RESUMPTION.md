# Fix Summary: Job Resumption on Page Refresh

## Issue
**"Running batch job disappears when page is refreshed"**

When users refreshed the web page during an active batch processing job, the progress UI would disappear even though the job continued running on the server. This created a poor user experience where it appeared the job had stopped.

## Root Cause
Race condition in the page load sequence. The code was:
1. Starting to load the file list (async, no await)
2. Checking for active jobs (async, with await)

Since `loadFiles()` was called without await, it could complete before `checkAndResumeActiveJob()` finished, causing the file list UI to render before the progress modal appeared.

## Solution
**Changed:** `templates/index.html` (DOMContentLoaded event handler)

Reordered the initialization sequence to check for active jobs FIRST:

### Before (Bug)
```javascript
loadFiles();                        // Starts loading (no await)
await checkAndResumeActiveJob();    // Checks for jobs (with await)
```

### After (Fixed)
```javascript
await checkAndResumeActiveJob();    // Check jobs FIRST (with await)
loadFiles();                        // Then load files (no await, background)
```

## Impact
- ✅ Progress modal now appears **immediately** when page refreshes with an active job
- ✅ No visible delay or UI flickering
- ✅ Jobs continue running seamlessly on the server
- ✅ File list loads in the background while progress is shown
- ✅ Minimal code change (3 lines modified)
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ No performance impact

## How It Works Now

### Normal Operation
1. User starts a batch job (e.g., "Process All Files")
2. Progress modal appears showing real-time progress
3. Job runs on server with concurrent processing
4. Progress updates every 500ms
5. On completion, success message appears and file list refreshes

### Page Refresh During Job
1. User refreshes the page
2. **Immediately**: Job resumption check runs
3. **If active job found**: Progress modal reappears instantly
4. Job polling resumes from where it left off
5. File list loads in the background
6. User sees seamless continuation of the job

### Key Benefits
- **Server-side persistence**: Jobs stored in SQLite database
- **Multi-worker support**: Works with Gunicorn multiple workers  
- **Multi-tab support**: All tabs see the same active job
- **Crash recovery**: Job resumes even after browser/server restart
- **Clean state management**: Active job properly tracked and cleaned up

## Technical Details

### Components Involved
1. **job_store.py**: Stores job state in `/Config/jobs.db` (SQLite)
2. **preferences_store.py**: Tracks active job in `/Config/preferences.db` (SQLite)
3. **job_manager.py**: Manages job execution with ThreadPoolExecutor
4. **web_app.py**: Provides API endpoints for job operations
5. **index.html**: Frontend UI and polling logic

### Database Storage
- **Jobs**: `/Config/jobs.db` - Job details, status, results
- **Active Job**: `/Config/preferences.db` - Currently active job ID and title
- Both use WAL mode for concurrent access across Gunicorn workers

### API Endpoints Used
- `POST /api/jobs/process-all` - Start processing all files
- `POST /api/jobs/process-selected` - Start processing selected files
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}` - Get job status and progress
- `POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/cancel` - Cancel a running job
- `GET /api/active-job` - Get currently active job
- `POST /api/active-job` - Set currently active job
- `DELETE /api/active-job` - Clear currently active job

## Testing
See `TESTING_FIX.md` for comprehensive testing instructions including:
- Test scenarios
- Expected behavior
- Console log verification
- Server-side verification commands
- Edge case testing

## Files Changed
- `templates/index.html` - Reordered DOMContentLoaded event handler

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Code change is minimal and focused
- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [x] Race condition eliminated
- [x] Progress modal appears immediately on refresh
- [x] Jobs continue running server-side
- [x] Proper error handling maintained
- [x] Multiple tabs supported
- [x] Documentation updated

## Deployment Notes
- No database migrations required
- No configuration changes required
- No new dependencies
- No server restart required (unless using Docker)
- Backward compatible with existing deployments

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Consider adding a visual indicator when a job is "resuming"
- Add notification sound/alert when long-running job completes
- Add option to email user when job completes
- Add job history view with past completed jobs
- Add ability to pause/resume jobs (currently only cancel)
