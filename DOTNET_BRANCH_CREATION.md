# Creating the dotnet Branch

## Objective
Create a new branch called `dotnet` based on the `master` branch.

## Status
âœ… The `dotnet` branch has been successfully created locally from `master` (commit 25dce09 - v1.0.42)

## Next Steps - Manual Action Required

Due to GitHub authentication limitations in the automated environment, the `dotnet` branch needs to be pushed to the remote repository manually. Please choose **one** of the following methods:

### Method 1: Create Branch Directly on GitHub (Recommended)
This is the simplest method:

1. Go to https://github.com/mleenorris/ComicMaintainer
2. Click on the branch dropdown (currently showing "master" or another branch)
3. Type "dotnet" in the search box
4. Click "Create branch: dotnet from 'master'"

### Method 2: Push from Local Repository
If you have this repository cloned locally with proper authentication:

```bash
# Fetch the latest changes
git fetch origin

# Create and push the dotnet branch from master
git push origin origin/master:refs/heads/dotnet
```

Or if you already have the branch locally:
```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b dotnet
git push -u origin dotnet
```

## Verification
Once the branch is created on GitHub, verify it exists:

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin dotnet
```

Expected output:
```
25dce09cba07e8a1270ef52d38f29e5b582b696b	refs/heads/dotnet
```

The branch should point to commit: `25dce09cba07e8a1270ef52d38f29e5b582b696b` (tag: v1.0.42)
